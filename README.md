# FakeItEasy.Sample
It's all about using FakeItEasy in your .NET projects to create fake objects for testing. Fake objects are like simplified versions of real objects that you can control during tests to make them behave exactly as you want.

The project was created to show you how to use FakeItEasy in your own unit tests. It's like a guide or a reference that helps you understand the best ways to use FakeItEasy effectively.

Inside the project, you'll find code examples that demonstrate how to set up and configure fake objects using FakeItEasy's fancy API. It covers a bunch of useful things, like making fake objects return specific values, throw exceptions, and verifying that certain methods were called.

It even goes into more advanced topics like handling asynchronous calls and dealing with property access. So, if you ever find yourself needing to test code that uses complex dependencies, this project will show you how to do it properly with FakeItEasy.

By checking out the source code and reading the documentation, you'll learn how to create fake objects, define their behavior, and make sure they're interacting correctly with your code. It's all about writing robust and reliable unit tests that make your software better.

So, if you're interested in improving your testing skills and making your code more reliable, give FakeItEasy.Sample a look. It's a great resource for learning how to use FakeItEasy effectively in your own projects.
